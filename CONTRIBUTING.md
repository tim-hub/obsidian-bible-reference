## Contribution for Obsidian Bible Reference

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

### Development and Contribution
- Typescript/Node Development Experience + [Obsidian Plugin Development](docs/ObsidianPluginDevelopment.md)
- [Hot reload plugin](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) (optional, but it is very handy for development purpose)
- [Obsidian Bible Reference Github Project](https://github.com/tim-hub/obsidian-bible-reference/projects/1)
  - There is lack of testing of the project, please help to improve it, if you have the willing
